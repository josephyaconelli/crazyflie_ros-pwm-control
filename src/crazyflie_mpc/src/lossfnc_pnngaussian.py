# Implementation of the loss function from the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12114

import torch
import numpy as np

class PNNLoss_Gaussian(torch.nn.Module):
    '''
    Here is a brief aside on why we want and will use this loss. Essentially, we will incorporate this loss function to include a probablistic nature to the dynamics learning nueral nets. The output of the Probablistic Nueral Net (PNN) or Bayesian Neural Net (BNN) will be both a mean for each trained variable and an associated variance. This loss function will take the mean (u), variance (sig), AND the true trained value (s) to compare against the mean. Stacked variances form Cov matrix

    loss_gaussian = sum_{data} (u - s)^T Cov^-1 (u-s) + log Det(Cov)

    Need to add code like this to the implementation:
         To bound the variance output for a probabilistic network to be between the upper and lower bounds found during training the network on the training data, we used the following code with automatic differentiation:

         logvar = max_logvar - tf.nn.softplus(max_logvar - logvar)
         logvar = min_logvar + tf.nn.softplus(logvar - min_logvar)
         var = tf.exp(logvar)

         with a small regularization penalty on term on max_logvar so that it does not grow beyond the training distribution’s maximum output variance, and on the negative of min_logvar so that it does not drop below the training distribution’s minimum output variance.
